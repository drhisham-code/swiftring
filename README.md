swiftring
=========

SwiftRing enables mouse shortcuts for any Mac / OS X application. SwiftRing was conceived in 2009, and available 
commercially in 2011/12. It was an interesting experiment in UI that coupled highly configurable gestures with a 
simple, non-obtrustive way to recall them. 

With the 2011 launch of the Mac app store and subsequent lockdown of apps that automated user input, coupled with
native gesture support in OS X via the magic mouse signalled the end of SwiftRing's useful life. It has been made fully
open source for anyone to use or modify at will.
