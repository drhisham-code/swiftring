SwiftRing
=========

SwiftRing enables mouse shortcuts for any Mac / OS X application. SwiftRing was conceived in 2009, and available 
commercially in 2011/12. It was an interesting experiment in UI that coupled highly configurable gestures with a 
simple, non-obtrustive way to recall them. 

With the 2011 launch of the Mac app store and subsequent lockdown of apps that automated user input, coupled with
native gesture support in OS X via the magic mouse signalled the end of SwiftRing's useful life. It has been made fully
open source for anyone to use or modify at will.

Using SwiftRing
---------------

The tutorial [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs338wL_mX0) is the best way to get familiar with SwiftRing. 

A brief summary of SwiftRing's capabilities is below. Also see the media links for in-depth reviews.

**The Basics**

 Once SwiftRing is installed, using it is very simple:
 
 * Hold down the option key to bring up the ring.
 * Touch a ring segment to perform the labeled action, no clicking is required.

 The extra action labels stacked on the top and bottom segments are activated using the mouse scroll wheel. 

**Customizing**

 Actions can be customized for any application - simply assign as many keystrokes and/or shortcuts as desired 
 to a ring segment using the preferences panel. The ring activation key (option by default) can also be changed.

 SwiftRing comes with built in support for Safari and iTunes. A generic ring is also supported to provide common actions  for unrecognized applications.

**Speed Demons**
 
 Power users can hold the option key, quickly touch a segment, and release option without the ring ever
 popping up for maximum efficiency. The scroll wheel can also be used to perform highly repetitive actions.
